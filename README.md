# rock-paper-scissor
This is a Javascript focused learning project while I was doing Odin Project Foundations. It's a rock-paper-scissor game upto 5 rounds against a computer.

This RPS game is played using a GUI, and the result is directly shown on the screen. This version no longer needs console for inputs or outputs.
