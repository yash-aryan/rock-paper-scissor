# rock-paper-scissor
This is a Javascript focused learning project while I was doing Odin Project Foundations. It's a rock-paper-scissor game upto 5 rounds against a computer.

Currently there is no GUI, the game is played using the browser console & pop-up menu. I will update this project soon, once I start learning even more.
